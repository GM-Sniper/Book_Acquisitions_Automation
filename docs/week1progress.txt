# Week 1 Progress Report: Foundation & API Configuration

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Development Environment Setup
- Created organized project structure with appropriate directories
- Set up Python virtual environment
- Installed and configured all required dependencies
- Initialized Git repository with proper .gitignore

### 2. API Integration & Testing

#### Library of Congress API
- Created test suite for ISBN to LCCN conversion (test_loc.py)
- Implemented SRU (Search/Retrieve via URL) service integration
- Successfully tested with sample ISBNs:
  - To Kill a Mockingbird (ISBN: 9780446310789)
  - Pride and Prejudice (ISBN: 9780141439518)
- Implemented XML response parsing and LCCN extraction
- Added error handling and rate limiting

#### Google Vision API
- Configured Google Cloud Vision API
- Created test suite for text extraction (test_google_vision.py)
- Successfully implemented:
  - Text detection
  - OCR functionality
- Tested with sample book cover images captured from a normal smartphone camera (Books with English and Arabic)

#### Gemini API (LLM Integration)
- Selected Gemini as the preferred LLM (alternative to Claude)
- Created test suite for LLM integration (test_gemini.py)
- Successfully tested text processing capabilities

### 3. Core Components Development

#### Image Processing Pipeline
- Created test suite for book cover processing (test_vision_with_books.py)
- Implemented basic image processing functionality
- Tested with real book cover images

#### ISBN Detection System
- Implemented ISBN extraction from text (in test_google_vision.py)
- Added validation and cleaning functions
- Integrated with text extraction pipeline

#### Metadata Processing
- Created basic metadata extraction framework
- Implemented LCCN conversion workflow

## Technical Achievements

### 1. API Integration Success
- Successfully integrated three major APIs:
  - Library of Congress (for LCCN)
  - Google Vision (for OCR)
  - Gemini (for text processing)
- All APIs are properly configured and tested
- Implemented proper error handling and rate limiting

### 2. Code Quality
- Implemented proper error handling
- Added comprehensive logging
- Created test suites for all major components
- Followed Python best practices and coding standards

### 3. Documentation
- Created detailed API documentation
- Added code comments and docstrings
- Maintained clear project structure
- Created this progress report
